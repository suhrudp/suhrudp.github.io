        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <br></br>
        <p>Welcome to my website! I'm Suhrud. After finishing medical school during my medical internship, I had the opportunity to work at apex Indian universities - the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, to gain experience in clinical research and artificial intelligence in healthcare.
            <br></br>
            I am passionate about neurology, especially vascular neurology, and am looking to do my residency in neurology to explore unique avenues in these fields. During my internship, I worked in general neurology in a large 1100-bed tertiary care teaching hospital and in interventional neurology in a 550-bed super-specialty teaching hospital in Pune, India. I have worked as a sub-intern in the neurology ward service at the Yale New Haven Hospital, the movement disorders clinic at Mayo Clinic, and vascular and interventional neurology at the University of Miami Jackson Memorial Hospital.
            <br></br>
            My love for mathematics during high school sublimated into a focus on statistics and probability during medical school. I have a YouTube channel where I aim to make biostatistics easier for medical students and residents by showing them how to perform statistical tests using open-source software correctly. By demystifying complex statistical models and interpreting research data, I aim to make biostatistics more accessible and relevant to healthcare and other professionals. My current interests lie in hierarchical Bayesian and non-linear modeling for quantitative data. As an editorial board member for 'Scientific Reports,' I have enjoyed using and honing my expertise in critically evaluating studies across a wide spectrum of scientific disciplines in neurology.
            <br></br>
            I am also interested in the role of artificial intelligence in computer vision to expedite and improve neurodiagnosis. I have experience in training machine and deep learning models to make novel radiomic predictions. Using grants I have received for two consecutive years from the Indian Council of Medical Research, I have been able to pursue my research in neurology to optimize neurodiagnosis in resource-limited settings. I have also received two prestigious scholarships from Tata Trusts for excellence in Medicine and Healthcare during my medical school.
            <br></br>
            ReQuir Statistics Solutions, a statistical consultancy firm that I have co-founded with 2 of my friends, was created with the idea to bridge the gap between the vast amount of rich untapped data in India and actionable insights. As the company evolved, so did our objectives, providing tailored solutions to hospitals, healthcare organizations, and individual researchers, helping them make data-driven decisions together in healthcare and beyond.
            <br></br>
            I have shared some source codes for real-world problems with my approach to complex statistical and AI models in my GitHub repositories. I have also included tutorial codes for the intermediate programmer using simulated datasets in R, SAS, Python, and Julia.
            <br></br>
            I love to play all kinds of sports, but the ones closest to my heart are calisthenics and table tennis. In my free time, I also play the guitar, love to experiment in the kitchen, am a PADI-certified open-water scuba diver, expand my knowledge on new discoveries in astronomy, and admire the color- and strokeplay by the 19th and 20th Century impressionists!
