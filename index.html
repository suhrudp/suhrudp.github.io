    <h2>Educational Background and Early Inspirations</h2>
    <br></br>
    <p>I finished medical school and a clinical internship in my hometown, Pune, India. My fascination with the brain’s structural connectivity, physiological resilience, and adaptability began during my first year of medical school. This passion grew as I pursued my medical education and clinical internship, which included the opportunity to work at two of India’s premier institutions: the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur. At these institutions, I focused on clinical research and artificial intelligence in healthcare, laying the foundation for my future aspirations.</p>
    <br></br>

    <h2>Neurology and Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <br></br>
    <p>Neurology and neuroscience has always been at the core of my professional interests. During my medical internship, I worked on the general neurology service at a large 1100-bed tertiary care teaching hospital in Pune, India. Additionally, I gained invaluable experience during rotations at Yale New Haven Hospital in the neurology ward service, at the Mayo Clinic in the movement disorders clinic, and at the University of Miami Jackson Memorial Hospital in vascular and interventional neurology. Inspired by the brain's complexity, I believe that the secrets to developing Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI) lie in understanding its structure and functionality. My current focus is on integrating explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models into clinical workflows to enhance decision-making and patient outcomes.</p>
    <br></br>

    <h2>Passion for Mathematics, Statistics, and Biostatistics</h2>
    <br></br>
    <p>My love for mathematics in high school sublimated into a passion for statistics and probability theory during medical school. To make biostatistics more accessible, I created a YouTube channel with simplified, follow-along tutorials for medical students and residents. These videos demonstrate practical applications of statistical tests using open-source software. By demystifying complex statistical models and interpreting research data, I aim to bridge the gap between biostatistics and its relevance in healthcare.</p>
    <br></br>

    <h2>Research Interests and Contributions</h2>
    <br></br>
    <p>My research interests center on interpretable predictive modeling using machine and deep learning algorithms. I have worked extensively in neuro-oncology, neurocritical care, behavioral neurology, and movement disorders. I’ve trained interpretable deep learning models to make novel radiomic and time-series predictions, paving the way for personalized medicine. Unlike surgical specialties, which are inherently personalized, medical fields like neurology can greatly benefit from predictive AI models to optimize treatment options, doses, and adverse effect profiles tailored to individual patients. Additionally, I have developed, patented, and deployed user-friendly software that enables clinicians to input imaging, sensor, and other data to generate robust predictions. These projects have been supported by two consecutive grants from the Indian Council of Medical Research and scholarships for excellence in Medicine and Healthcare from Tata Trusts.</p>
    <br></br>

    <h2>Editorial and Consultancy Work</h2>
    <br></br>
    <p>As an editorial board member for Nature’s Scientific Reports, I critically evaluate studies across neurology subspecialties, focusing on neuroinformatics and predictive models. I also co-founded ReQuir Statistics Solutions, a consultancy firm aimed at bridging the gap between healthcare professionals and high-quality analytics. Initially created to serve busy clinicians, our firm now provides tailored solutions to larger hospitals and health AI firms, empowering them to make data-driven decisions efficiently.</p>
    <br></br>

    <h2>Programming and Educational Outreach</h2>
    <br></br>
    <p>I actively share programming resources on my GitHub, including real-world problem-solving codes and tutorial scripts for intermediate programmers in R, SAS, Python, and Julia. These resources aim to encourage healthcare professionals to leverage data analytics and programming in their practice.</p>
    <br></br>

    <h2>Hobbies and Personal Interests</h2>
    <br></br>
    <p>Outside of work, I engage in various hobbies. I am passionate about calisthenics, stair-climbing, and table tennis. I enjoy playing the guitar and exploring different musical styles. I love experimenting in the kitchen with diverse cuisines. As a certified PADI open-water diver, I also find joy in scuba diving. Additionally, I admire the color and strokeplay of 19th- and 20th-century impressionists.</p>
    <br></br>

    <h2>Vision for the Future</h2>
    <br></br>
    <p>The first artificial neural network was proposed by Warren McCulloch in 1943, a neurologist by training who worked at MIT with Walter Pitts. He was so inspired by the brain's microscopic architecture that they modeled this artificial neural network based on a frog's visual system. I believe by unlocking the physiological resilience, adaptability, and homeostatic phenomena of the human nervous system, we will be able to unlock true Artificial Superintelligence. I envision the future of AI as one where we collaborate with basic neuroscientists to translate these insights effectively.</p>
