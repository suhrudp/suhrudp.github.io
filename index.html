        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome! I just finished medical school and am passionate about endovascular neurosurgery. In addition to my interest in interventional neurology and neurosurgery, I am deeply engrossed in statistics and probability. My fascination with numbers doesn't stop at clinical diagnoses; it extends to educating medical students and residents through my YouTube channel focused on biostatistics. By demystifying complex statistical models and interpreting research data, I aim to make biostatistics more accessible and relevant to both healthcare professionals and the general public.

           I also am interested in the role of artificial intelligence in precision medicine and have built a few supervised deep learning models to supplement radiological diagnostic capabilities.
           
           I've also co-founded ReQuir Statistics Solutions, a statistical consultancy firm that bridges the gap between data and actionable insights. We provide tailored solutions to healthcare organizations and individual researchers, helping them make data-driven decisions in healthcare and beyond.
            
           Feel free to explore my academic portfolio, watch my YouTube channel, or get in touch for any statistical consultation you might need.</p>
