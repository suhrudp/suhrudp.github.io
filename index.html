        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <br></br>
        <p>Welcome! I'm Suhrud! I am currently a Neurology Resident at Mayo Clinic. After finishing medical school, I had the opportunity to work at two of India’s premier institutions – the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur – focusing on clinical research and artificial intelligence in healthcare.
    <br></br>
    The first artificial neural network was proposed by Dr. Warren McCulloch in 1943, a neuropsychologist by training who worked at MIT with Walter Pitts. He was so inspired by the brain's microscopic architecture that they modeled this artificial neural network based on a frog's visual system. I, too, have been similarly awestruck by the brain's structural connectivity with its physiological resilience and adaptability since my first year of medical school, and believe that the secrets to building the next generation of Artificial General Intelligence can be found here. 
    <br></br>
    My love for mathematics in high school sublimated into a passion for statistics and probability theory during med school. My current research interests include interpretable predictive modeling using machine and deep learning algorithms. As an editorial board member for Nature’s 'Scientific Reports,' I critically evaluate studies across neurology subspecialties, focusing on neuroinformatics and predictive modeling.
    <br></br>
    I am interested in integrating computer vision with trustworthy generative AI to improve neurodiagnosis and advance personalized medicine. Neurology still has a long way to go in tailoring treatment to individual patient profiles, and I believe AI models trained on large datasets can help close this gap. I am passionate about integrating explainable artificial intelligence models into clinical workflows.. I’ve built and deployed interpretable AI tools for radiomics, time-series analysis, and behavioral phenotyping in neuro-oncology, neurocritical care, and movement disorders. These models have been developed and validated even in resource-limited settings, thanks to consecutive research grants from the Indian Council of Medical Research and two prestigious Tata Trusts scholarships.
    <br></br>
    ReQuir Statistics Solutions is a statistical consultancy firm I co-founded with two friends to help healthcare professionals access fast, high-quality analytics. Over time, we’ve grown to support larger hospitals and AI startups, helping them make smarter, data-driven decisions.
    <br></br>
    I’ve shared real-world code, tutorials, and tools for R, SAS, Python, and Julia on GitHub for both beginners and intermediate programmers. I also have a YouTube channel where I upload simplified follow-along tutorials for medical students and residents, demonstrating how to perform statistical tests using open-source software practically.
    <br></br>
    In my free time, I love playing sports, especially calisthenics, stair-climbing, and table tennis. I also play the guitar, enjoy cooking, am a PADI-certified open-water scuba diver, and admire the strokeplay of impressionist painters.
    <br></br>
    Please feel free to get in touch with me!
