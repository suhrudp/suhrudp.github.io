        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my website! I'm Suhrud. After finishing medical school, I worked at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, to gain experience in clinical research and artificial intelligence in healthcare.
            <br></br>
            I am passionate about interventional neurology and endovascular neurosurgery and am looking to pursue my residency and fellowship in these fields.
            <br></br>
            My love for mathematics during high school sublimated into a focus on statistics and probability during medical school. I have a YouTube channel where I aim to make biostatistics easier for medical students and residents by showing how to correctly perform statistical tests in open-source softwares. By demystifying complex statistical models and interpreting research data, I aim to make biostatistics more accessible and relevant to both healthcare professionals and the general public.
            <br></br>
            I am also interested in the role of artificial intelligence in precision medicine and have built a few supervised deep learning models to supplement radiological diagnostic capabilities.
            <br></br>
            I have also co-founded ReQuir Statistics Solutions, a statistical consultancy firm that bridges the gap between data and actionable insights. We provide tailored solutions to healthcare organizations and individual researchers, helping them make data-driven decisions in healthcare and beyond.
            <br></br>
            Feel free to explore my academic portfolio, watch my YouTube channel, or get in touch for any statistical or AI consultation you might need.</p>
